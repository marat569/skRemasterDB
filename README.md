My personal list of games and what remasters work with SpeicalK.

This list assumes the games are on **STEAM** , I don't have any other platform

**Tales of Arise**
  - 8 + 10 bit remasters work
  
  - 11 bit remasters cause artifacts

**Fate/Samurai Remnant**
  - sRGB Bypass Required
  
  - All remasters work **EXCEPT** 8 bit render passes

**STRANGER OF PARADISE FINAL FANTASY ORIGIN**
  - sRGB Bypass Required

  - 8 bit render passes are **Mandatory** to get the game looking normal
    - Overbright bits on highlights

    - 10/11 bit remasters passes destroy the image. Do not use them.

**ONE PIECE ODYSSEY**
  - 8 + 11 bit render passes
      - If only 8 bit render passes are enabled, the game looks Magenda, While both 8 plus 11 enabled at the same time look great

**CRISIS CORE –FINAL FANTASY VII– REUNION**

  - Remasters do not work
    - 8 Bit remasters crash the game
    - 10/11 bit remasters create artifacts

**Trinity Trigger**
  - All remasters work
      - Overbright bits created
   
**Like a Dragon: Ishin!** (-d3d11)
  - All render passes work
    - Eats up a fair bit of vram due to the large number of render passes

    - Assumes the game is running in DirectX11 via the -d3d11 launch argument
