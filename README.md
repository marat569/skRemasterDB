My personal list of games and what remasters work with SpeicalK.

This list assumes the games are on **STEAM** , I don't have any other platform

**Fate/Samurai Remnant**
  - sRGB Bypass Required
  
  - All remasters work **EXCEPT** 8 bit render passes

**STRANGER OF PARADISE FINAL FANTASY ORIGIN**
  - sRGB Bypass Required

  - 8 bit render passes are **Mandatory** to get the game looking normal
    - Overbright bits on highlights
